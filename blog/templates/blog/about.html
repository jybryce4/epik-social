    <div class="content-section">
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>
            ePik is a social network by James Bryce (on-site as Jamey).
            He wrote the site using the <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> framework and it is currently
            open-source on github. 
        </p>

        <h4>What makes ePIK different?</h4>
        <p>
            ePIK should be a breath of fresh air in a world dominated by Facebook and Twitter. Similar to Tumblr, but unique in style, your data is not collected
            or monetized by the ePIK Social organization. We are not looking to profit, so we do not target ads at you nor collect your personal information.
        </p>
